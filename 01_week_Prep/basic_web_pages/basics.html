        <h1>Interneting is Easy</h1>
        <p>First, we will need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

        <h2>Headings</h2>
        <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of
             headings.</p>

        <h2>Lists</h2>
        <p>This is how you make an unordered list.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add an "ul" element (e.g. unordered list)</li>
            <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
            <li>Since this is unordered, the order is not specific</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Practical uses: item inventories; product features</p>

        <p>Do this</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Place "p" elements within "li" elements</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Do not do this</p>
        <ul>
            <p>This is wrong</p>
        </ul>

        <h2>Ordered Lists</h2>
        <p>This is how you make an ordered list.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Add an "ol" element (e.g. ordered list)</li>
            <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
            <li>Order is key here</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Practical uses: recipes; instructions; tables of content</p>

        <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
        <p>
            <em>Sometimes,</em> we need to draw attention to a particular word
            or phrase.
        </p>
        <p>
            Other times we need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasis a
        particular word or phrase.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>
                <strong>Other times, we need to shout!</strong>
            </em>
        </p>

        <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
        <p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now.</p>
        <p>Regards,<br/>
        The Authors</p>

        <p>This page may not look well, but we will fix it with CSS later.</p>
